# RNN_timeforecasting

You would like to model stock prices correctly, so as a stock buyer you can reasonably decide when to buy stocks and when to sell them to make a profit. This is where time series modelling comes in. You need good machine learning models that can look at the history of a sequence of data and correctly predict what the future elements of the sequence are going to be.

The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network in Keras supports multiple input features.

LSTM built using the Keras Python package to predict time series steps and sequences

The data set used is freely avaiable and can be downloaded from https://finance.yahoo.com.

Our goal is to predict the upward and downward trend of stock using RNN-LSTM.
